I did two versions because I wanted to see the difference between one function with everything
inside (Version 1) and multiple functions (Version 2).
- What I see in those two versions:
  - The code is more clean in version 2
  - The code is more readable in version 2
  - I can add easily new operations in both versions
  - I think it's not good practice to get user input like in version 1 (I think)
  - In version 1 ".isdigit" is not added because anyway you need to write the two numbers and operator
- What I prefer to use:
  - Probably version 2
