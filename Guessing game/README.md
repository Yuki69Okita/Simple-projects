Guessing game:
--------------
- Version 1:
  - Random number will be generated from the program
  - The user need to guess it
  - Hints like "Lower" or "Higher"
  - Three lives
  - If it's not a number
    - print a message to enter valid number
  - If the number is out of range
    - print a message to enter new number within the range
- Version 2:
  - The user will think of a number
  - The program need to guess it
  - Ask the user for "Correct", "Lower" or "Higher"
    - l for "Lower"
    - h for "Higher"
    - c for "Correct"
  - If the list is out of range
    - print message that is not possible
  - Three lives
------------------
They are two versions because I wanted to see how different are "user guessing" for "computer guessing".
- What I see in those two versions:
  - Version 1 is very simple comparison to version 2
  - Version 2 have many statements
  - Version 2 have a "tiny" problem:
    - when user type something different from h, l and c
      - it's printing not possible number
      - I will fix it someday
- There is plenty of room to improve but for now I'm happy with results
