# Simple projects:
- Here I will add simple projects. Just to practice how to write code and solve problems.
---------------------------------------------
# Project 1 (Calculator):
  - Asking the user two numbers and operator
  - Do simple arithmetic operation with the numbers
    - \+
    - \-
    - \/
    - \*
  - If the user type something different form number or different operator
    - print message
  - Do it with function/s
  ---------------------------------------------
  # Project 2 (Guessing game):
  - Random number will be generated
  - Someone needs to guess it
  - Hints (Higher, Lower or Correct)
    - depends who is guessing
      - user - h or l
      - computer - h, l or c
